        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Paper Cutz is a battlebot competition with a twist. Competitors build robots
            designed to destroy, damage, or otherwise incapacitate their rivals, but no
            specialized building skills are required, since all bots must be made out of
            cardboard and masking tape.</p>

    <div id="rules" class="container">
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bots must be constructed exclusively from cardboard and masking tape
                (aside from electrical components).</li>
            <li>Bots can have up to three electic motors plus control circuitry.</li>
            <li>Construction teams can be of any size and include roboticists of any age
                but drivers must be under 12 years old.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Competition</h3>
        <p>Competitions are composed of three different events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"If Looks Could Kill": This event consists of a vote for the coolest,
                most beautiful, or otherwise best looking robot in the field.
            </li>
            <li>
                "Twinkle Toes": This timed event will require bots to navigate an
                obstacle course filled with traps and hurdles. Fastest time wins!
            </li>
            <li>"Paper Shredder": The main event! Competitors are drafted into a single
                elimintation bracket where two bots enter and only one bot leaves!
                Winners are determined to be either the last bot standing, or, if both
                bots are still operating, the one voted to have done the most damage by
                a panel of judges.
            </li>
        </ul>
